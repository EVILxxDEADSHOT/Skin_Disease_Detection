# Skin_Disease_Detection
This project focuses on the automatic detection and classification of common skin diseases from images using Deep Learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to analyze skin images and predict the most likely disease class, helping in early-stage diagnosis and awareness.
