# 🩺 Skin Disease Detection

An intelligent system that detects and classifies **common skin diseases from images** using **Deep Learning**.

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained to analyze skin images and predict the most likely disease class, supporting **early-stage diagnosis and awareness**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- 📸 Image-based skin disease classification  
- 🧠 CNN-powered deep learning model  
- ⚡ Fast and automated predictions  
- 🔁 Pre-trained model (no retraining required)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- NumPy, OpenCV / PIL  

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Input a skin image  
2. Image preprocessing (resize & normalize)  
3. CNN model prediction  
4. Disease class is displayed
